# Miscellaneous projects/items
A repo for all of my miscellaneous projects that don't fit into their own category
This contains snippets of code, music and other things I have created that don't necesitate their own repo.

## Music
Over the years I've dabbled in creating music; some tracks are in the form of background music and others full songs yet to be finalised.

### Summer Regeton
Spanish summer music is all the rage right now so I decided to create this song to emulate what I've been hearing a lot on the radio

### GangsterGoose Boss Battle Theme
This will be the theme song played during the boss battle of my [tamagochi-style python game](https://github.com/KurtBurgess/The-Lewis-Game-a-Tamagochi-Style-Flat-Mate)
